# MHD Equilibrium

This is a repository of project scripts for the ITCR Plasma Laboratory. It considers some magnetic field calculation routines for the MEDUSA tokamak, particle trajectories using the SCR-1 magnetic field, and diagnostics for SCR-1 magnetic field errors.

These projects are still on-course and updated periodically.
